# The Dragon's Lair CTF
An in-house CTF created entirely in bash

## Synopsis
Red team and blue team compete in an Attack-and-Defend style Capture the Flag competition with Forensics challenges included. Both teams participate in attacking and defending; team colors are not associated with only attacking or only defending. There are six levels in the competition, each team receives points for completing levels and loses points for using hints to complete the levels. The host system displays the current scores and communicates with the two teams to give them each level as they unlock it. Each level contains a readme file for instructions.

## Setup Instructions
Install Ubuntu 12 or 14 on three computers/virtual machines. Name the main user for each of the three systems: `redteam`, `blueteam`, and `hostsystem`. On each system, run `SetupScript.sh` with sudo.
