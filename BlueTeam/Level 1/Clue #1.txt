As St. George traveled around the world,
He influenced two future great cultures.
Two icons, or should I say flags,
Were left in his honor,
Yet some attribute them
To other notable heroes, such as St. Ambrose.
These two icons,
Though in different parts of the world,
Are the same thing,
But with different meaning.
